Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models, experiments, and tools built for learning, testing, and deployment. Each project focuses on a different aspect of ML â€” from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model evaluation and optimization. This repository is a collection of experiments, models, and notes as I explore machine learning concepts and applications. It includes projects that cover both supervised and unsupervised learning, along with data preprocessing, model tuning, and performance evaluation.
